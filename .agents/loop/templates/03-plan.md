# <Task title> — implementation plan

> PLAN output. The phase index at the top is the summary; everything below is
> detail. BUILD reads one phase at a time.

- Functional spec: [`01-functional.md`](./01-functional.md)
- Architecture: [`02-architecture.md`](./02-architecture.md)

## Phase index

| # | Phase | Size | Depends on | Status |
|---|-------|------|------------|--------|
| 1 | | S/M/L | — | TODO |

Sizes: S ≈ half a day, M ≈ 1–2 days, L → split it.
Status per phase: `TODO` · `WIP` · `DONE`. BUILD updates this table as it goes;
it is what lets `WIP:BUILD (3/7)` resume correctly.

## Working agreement

- One phase = one commit (or one PR). Each phase ships independently, keeps
  `npm run gate` green, and is revertable on its own.
- Failing test first, then the implementation.
- We do not move to phase N+1 until phase N's acceptance criteria are met.
- Re-ordering phases mid-build is a decision to surface, not to take silently.

## Phase 1 — <name>

**Goal.** One sentence.

**Deliverables.**
- Files created or modified, concretely.

**Tests.**
- The integration tests that prove it, named as they will be named.

**Acceptance.**
- ✅ Checkable statements, not intentions.
- ✅ `npm run gate` green.

## Visual QA checklist

Filled by VERIFY. One row per surface worth looking at with real eyes, written
during PLAN while the flows are fresh.

## Open items

Anything the plan depends on but has not confirmed (e.g. "does
`StoryPublicApi::isAuthorOrCoAuthor` exist?"). Each must be resolved before the
phase that needs it starts.
