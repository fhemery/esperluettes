# Search module

Global search (Stories + Profiles) rendered via a single Blade partial, visibility-aware and optimized for live results below the top bar input.

The search module is composed of:
- a component displaying in a Search bar, either directly enabling typing (desktop) or opening a panel to type (mobile)
- a partial rendering of both found profiles and found stories.
