# Discord module

This module exposes endpoint for the Discord bot developped by Midriass (https://github.com/DrOwlFR/Hestia) to give the correct access to the users.
It also provide a (very small) UI component to enable user to connect and disconnect.

It should also be the module that provides the notifications to the Discord bot.

## Authentication

The authentication is done using an API key that is shared between the site and the Discord bot.

## Possible operations

See [Discord API usage](../../../docs/Feature_Planning/Discord_Api_Usage.md) for more information.

User connection is done by the user coming on the website and retrieve a code to provide the Discord bot.
