# Setup Windows with Laragon

Instead of using Docker and `sail` as described in the [Setup](./Setup.md), you can use a manual setup. 
For Windows, **you cannot use XAMPP**, because it currently only serves PHP 8.2 and we are running 8.3. Thus, you should use [Laragon](https://laragon.org).

## Windows - Laragon

1. Install Laragon
Download from [Laragon](https://laragon.org)

This includes PHP, Composer, MySQL, Apache and even Nodejs. 

Install it where you want. You're almost done already!

2. Change document root

In Laragon, go to the Settings (top-right wheel icon).
There, you can change the Document root. You can also setup virtual hosts.

3. Add Laragon to path

In the Laragon Panel, right click, then go to `Tools > Path > Add Laragon to Path`.

Restart your IDE (or your computer) after doing this.

4. Activate `zip` PHP extension.

In the Laragon Panel, right click, then go to `PHP > Extensions` and check `zip`.

5. Create a database

In the Laragon Panel, right click, then go to `MySQL > Create Database` and give it the name you want.

6. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your .env file with the MySQL database name (the one you just created), user (root) and password (empty).

7. In project directory, run :

```bash
composer install
npm install
npm run build
php artisan generate:key
php artisan migrate:install
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
php artisan storage:link
```

You are up and running on the domain you configured in step 2 (for example, http://esperluettes.test).

From that point one, you can basically replace all `sail` command by `php` :
- You can use `composer` directly
- But `sail artisan ...` becomes `php artisan ...`

Go to the [First Steps](./Setup.md#first-steps-after-installation) section for the remaining steps

## Working with the app

### Start and stop the environment 
Just go to Laragon and start/stop the Apache server and the mysql server.

### Regenerate javascript and tailwind classes (whenever you touch javascript)

Either once:
> npm run build

Or on every change (very useful for development):
> npm run dev
