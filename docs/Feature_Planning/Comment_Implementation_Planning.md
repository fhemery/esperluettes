# Comment Domain Implementation Planning

## User Story-Based Feature Slices

This document breaks down the Comment domain implementation into atomic user stories with associated feature tests. Each story is small, testable, independently valuable, and backed by feature tests.

Phases:
- [Phase 1: Core Commenting (Chapters & News)](./Comment_Implementation_Planning_Phase1.md)
- Phase 2: Moderation & Deactivation
- Phase 3: Unanswered Comment Indicators (Story), Counts, and Badges
- Phase 4: Enhancements (Permalinks UX, Notifications, Rate Limits)

## Implementation Strategy

### Testing Approach
- Feature tests for user flows (post, reply, edit, list, anchors, permissions)
- Unit tests for service methods (sanitization, threading validation)

### Validation Criteria Per Story
- ✅ Feature test passes
- ✅ Manual browser validation
- ✅ No existing tests broken
- ✅ Code clean and documented
- ✅ Demonstrable to stakeholders

### Development Process
1. Write Feature Test
2. Implement Minimum Code
3. Refactor
4. Manual Validation
5. Move to Next Story
