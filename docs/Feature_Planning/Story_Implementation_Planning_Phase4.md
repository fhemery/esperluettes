# Story Domain Implementation Planning - Phase 4

## **US-039: Upload Story Cover**

**As a story author, I want to upload a cover image so that my story is visually appealing.**

## **US-041: Co-Author Management (Invite/Leave, Equal Rights)**

**As an author or co-author, I want to invite co-authors and manage collaboration with equal rights.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Any author or co-author can invite additional co-authors
- No one can remove co-authors after acceptance
- Any co-author, including the initial author, can leave the story
- Co-authors have the same editing/publishing permissions as the initial author

**Implementation:**

- Actions for invite and leave; permissions aligned across authors/co-authors; no removal action
