# Story Domain Implementation Planning

## User Story-Based Feature Slices

This document breaks down the Story domain implementation into atomic user stories with associated feature tests. Each
user story is:

- **A single, testable user capability**
- **Independently valuable**
- **Small enough to implement and validate quickly**
- **Backed by comprehensive feature tests**

This file has been broken down into phases to keep track of the status :

- [Phase 1 : Basic Story Management](./Story_Implementation_Planning_Phase1.md)
- [Phase 2 : Story Details Management](./Story_Implementation_Planning_Phase2.md)
- [Phase 3 : Chapter Management](./Story_Implementation_Planning_Phase3.md)
- [Phase 4 : Story Publishing Management

## Implementation Strategy

### **Testing Approach**

- **Feature Tests**: Primary testing method for user stories
- **Unit Tests**: Added for complex business logic
- **Browser Tests**: Only for complex UI interactions

### **Validation Criteria Per Story**

✅ Feature test passes  
✅ Manual browser test works  
✅ No existing tests broken  
✅ Code is clean and documented  
✅ Story is demonstrable to stakeholders

### **User Story Development Process**

1. **Write Feature Test**: Start with the test that defines the behavior
2. **Implement Minimum Code**: Write just enough code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Clean up code while keeping tests green
4. **Manual Validation**: Test the feature in browser
5. **Move to Next Story**: Only after current story is complete

### **Benefits of User Story Approach**

- **User-Focused**: Each story delivers value to a specific user type
- **Testable**: Clear acceptance criteria translate to feature tests
- **Incremental**: Each story builds on previous functionality
- **Demonstrable**: Stakeholders can see and validate each capability
- **Flexible**: Stories can be reordered based on priorities
- **Traceable**: Easy to track which features are complete
